## Axion-Emulator

# Generate.py
This is where you can run the pipeline. Insert you COLE and axionCAMB executable and the desired output file, along with the parameters you want to run with. With run_sim you run the pipeline. If you want to make your own latin hypercube sampling, you can use make_LHS to choose the limits (and add more parameters if you want), and execute with run_pipeline.

# test_axion_dependency.py
An example of how the emulator can be used is presented here.
